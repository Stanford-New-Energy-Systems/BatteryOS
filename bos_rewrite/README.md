### Battery Operating System 

The Battery Operating System (BOS) is designed for virtualizing energy storage batteries typically used in combination with distributed energy resources (DERs). BOS provides support for aggregating and partitioning physical or virtual batteries into complex topologies that can be used for a variety of use cases. BOS is written in C++ and uses named fifos to send commands to batteries on local systems.
